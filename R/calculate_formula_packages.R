# The objective of this script is to document the methodology on how to
# calculate the amount of baby formula package units a baby needs during its
# first two years of life.

# To estimate the amount of baby formula powder units (900gr), the following
# information is needed:
# - formula powder per bottle/serving in grams
# - recommended amount of servings/bottles per day
# - how the previous two vary as the baby grows

# based on l√∂wenzahn organics baby formula instructions

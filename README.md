# Study - The cost of inaction on nutrition in emergencies in Latin America and the Caribbean
Repository in support of the Study - The cost of inaction on nutrition in emergencies in Latin America and the Caribbean

The Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region is highly susceptible to natural disasters, due to structural poverty, inequality, and pervasive violence. This affects millions of vulnerable people every year, especially the nutritional status of children under five years of age and pregnant and lactating women (PLW), with humanitarian needs. Additionally, the region experiences significant migration flows, making LAC a region with a high per capita number of migrants, including refugees and displaced persons. Disasters and humanitarian crises severely impact nutritional status, especially among children under five and PLW, leading to increased risks of infectious diseases, malnutrition, and long-term cognitive and physical impairments. Despite the critical importance of nutrition responses in emergencies, global funding often prioritises other sectors over direct nutritional interventions, overlooking the nuanced needs of the population groups most vulnerable to malnutrition  and the long-term benefits of nutritional support. UNICEF emphasises the importance of prioritising, funding and implementing nutrition interventions in response to an emergency to prevent malnutrition and its severe outcomes, highlighting the need for increased political and financial support for nutrition-specific interventions to address the challenges faced by the most vulnerable in LAC. The primary objective of this multi-country study was to assess the human and economic implications of failing to fund and therefore implement a nutrition-focused response in specific emergencies in the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region targeting children under five years old, with an additional emphasis on those under two, as well as pregnant and lactating women.

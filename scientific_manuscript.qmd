  This multi-country study, commissioned by UNICEF Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office (LACRO), quantifies the human and economic costs of under-delivery of nutrition-specific services during emergencies (2020–2022). Using a Cost of Inaction framework, we compare four coverage scenarios—0% (no action), implemented, 30%, and 95%—for two crisis typologies: the Eta–Iota hurricane response and regional migration flows. Direct benefits (stillbirths and under-five deaths averted; changes in wasting, stunting, and exclusive breastfeeding) were estimated using the Lives Saved Tool (LiST). Indirect benefits monetise exclusive-breastfeeding gains as avoided household expenditure on breast-milk substitutes and preserved future income linked to cognition. Costs were standardised to constant 2015 USD, with present values for cognition calculated from a 2022 base year at 3–5% real discount rates. 
  Implemented coverage averaged ~31% in Eta–Iota settings and ~2.7% in migration contexts, with expenditures representing only 17% and 14% of the investment required for 95% coverage, respectively. Scaling to 95% coverage would avert additional stillbirths and child deaths and increase exclusive breastfeeding substantially. Undiscounted indirect benefits would rise to ~US$68.3 million (Eta–Iota) and ~US$336.9 million (migration). Principal component and cluster analyses identify a pragmatic sequencing of services—from universally feasible child-preventive functions to diagnostics/treatment and maternal iron/IFA dependent on system readiness.
  
  Underinvestment in Nutrition in Emergencies generates measurable and avoidable losses. Scenario-based budgets and phased packages aligned with readiness triggers provide a practical pathway to close coverage gaps, improve survival, and preserve human capital.

> **Plain language summary:**  Under‑funding nutrition services during crises in Latin America and the Caribbean results in preventable child deaths and lost economic potential. Using scenarios from “no response” to “near‑universal coverage”, we estimate how many deaths could be averted and what financial benefits families and societies could gain, particularly through higher exclusive‑breastfeeding. We also identify which services are most feasible to start first, and which require stronger health systems.

# Introduction

Latin America and the Caribbean is the world’s second most disaster-prone region and hosts some of the largest per-capita migration flows globally. Crises triggered by climate events and displacement interact with chronic vulnerabilities, especially among children under five and pregnant or lactating women (PLW). Nutrition in Emergencies (NiE), a life-saving component of humanitarian action, remains critically underfunded and often conflated with food security. Unlike food assistance, NiE delivers targeted preventive and therapeutic services to mitigate acute malnutrition and safeguard maternal and child health. In 2020–2022, the nutrition sector received as little as 1.6% of required funds in major emergencies (@OCHAFTS2022). This study quantifies the consequences of under-delivery using a Cost of Inaction (CoI) lens (@Anand2001) to inform humanitarian programming, monitoring and evaluation.

# Methods

We adapted a CoI framework to estimate forgone benefits under four scenarios: no action (0%), current implementation, moderate scale-up (30%), and ideal (95%) coverage. Direct (constitutive) benefits include lives saved and reduced malnutrition, modelled through the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) (@Walker2013). Indirect (consequential) benefits include household cost savings on breast-milk substitutes (BMS) and preserved income from cognition gains linked to exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) (e.g., @Victora2016). Programme cost data were compiled from UNICEF country offices and standardised to constant 2015 USD. Principal components analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis identified patterns in delivery feasibility across countries and crises. Full model assumptions and sensitivity checks are provided in Supplementary Materials, and minimum standards references follow Sphere guidance (@Sphere2018).

# Results

## Funding and Coverage Gaps

In the Eta/Iota hurricane response, implemented coverage was ~31%, while migration settings saw only ~2.7% coverage. Estimated investments for 95% coverage were US\$37.8 million and US\$111.3 million, respectively, but actual spending reached only 17% and 14% of those targets.

**Figure 2**: Principal component analysis (PCA) biplot showing variation in NiE delivery service clusters by feasibility and implementation across country contexts.

Three core service clusters were identified:

* **Cluster 1**: Standard child-preventive bundle (feasible in all settings).
* **Cluster 2**: Diagnostics and treatment (dependent on functional systems).
* **Cluster 3**: Maternal iron/IFA interventions (limited to stable ANC platforms).

# Discussion

Despite moderate investment, NiE interventions have saved lives. However, the inaction gap remains vast. High returns to scale in migration settings suggest that even modest increases in funding could yield outsized health and economic returns. Service clustering highlights the need for phased implementation aligned with system readiness. The CoI framework usefully articulates missed opportunities and informs humanitarian decision-making (@Anand2001).

**Implications for humanitarian action.** Results support (i) prioritising universally feasible preventive services for rapid start-up; (ii) scaling diagnostics/treatment as system functionality allows; and (iii) integrating maternal services where antenatal platforms are stable. Scenario-based budgeting can improve appeal design and donor engagement, consistent with sector standards (@Sphere2018).

**Limitations.** LiST may under-detect effects for some maternal/neonatal outcomes where intervention coverage is low or clustered. Economic proxies rely on literature-based links between EBF and cognition; country-specific earnings paths introduce uncertainty addressed through sensitivity analysis.

# Conclusion

Nutrition in Emergencies is a core humanitarian function. Underinvestment produces preventable mortality and long-run losses in human capital. Applying a Cost of Inaction lens shows that moving from current to 95% coverage could yield outsized health and economic returns, especially in displacement-affected settings. Sequencing services—from a universal child-preventive bundle to diagnostics/treatment and maternal iron/IFA as systems allow—offers a feasible route to scale. Donors and implementers should adopt scenario-based budgets tied to readiness triggers to convert the documented inaction gap into realised survival and productivity gains.

Phased intervention packages aligned with system readiness, supported by scenario-based budgeting, provide a pragmatic pathway for governments, donors, and humanitarian actors to close funding gaps and prioritise lifesaving interventions. Strengthening NiE within humanitarian appeals and coordination mechanisms is therefore urgent, both to save lives in the short term and to safeguard development gains in the long term.

Future work should deepen the evidence base by integrating real-time implementation data, expanding to additional crisis contexts, and refining economic valuation approaches. Doing so will strengthen the case for sustainable financing of NiE as a central pillar of humanitarian action in Latin America and the Caribbean and beyond.

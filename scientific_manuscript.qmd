  **Background**  Nutrition in Emergencies (NiE) is central to humanitarian action but remains chronically underfunded in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Evidence quantifying the humanitarian and economic implications of under-delivery is limited.

  **Methods**  We adapted a cost of inaction (CoI) framework to compare four coverage scenarios (0%, implemented, 30%, 95%) for NiE packages across two crisis typologies (Hurricanes Eta/Iota; regional migration flows) between 2020–2022. Direct effects (mortality and malnutrition) were estimated using the Lives Saved Tool (LiST). Indirect effects monetised exclusive-breastfeeding (EBF) gains via avoided household spending on breast-milk substitutes and preserved future income linked to cognition. Costs were harmonised to constant 2015 USD. Principal components analysis (PCA) explored delivery feasibility clusters.

  **Results**  Implemented coverage averaged ~31% in Eta/Iota settings and ~2.7% in migration contexts. Scaling to 95% coverage could avert additional child deaths and stillbirths and materially expand EBF. The undiscounted indirect benefits of full coverage were on the order of tens to hundreds of millions of USD across settings. PCA identified three delivery clusters: (1) universally feasible child-preventive services; (2) diagnostics and treatment dependent on functional systems; (3) maternal iron/IFA contingent on antenatal platforms.

  **Conclusions**  Underinvestment in NiE leads to preventable mortality and foregone human capital. Scenario-based budgeting and phased packages aligned with system readiness can increase humanitarian effectiveness. Findings are relevant to programming, monitoring and evaluation in humanitarian action.

> **Plain language summary**  Under‑funding nutrition services during crises in Latin America and the Caribbean results in preventable child deaths and lost economic potential. Using scenarios from “no response” to “near‑universal coverage”, we estimate how many deaths could be averted and what financial benefits families and societies could gain, particularly through higher exclusive‑breastfeeding. We also identify which services are most feasible to start first, and which require stronger health systems.

# Introduction

Latin America and the Caribbean is the world’s second most disaster‑prone region and hosts some of the largest per‑capita migration flows globally. Crises triggered by climate events and displacement interact with chronic vulnerabilities, especially among children under five and pregnant or lactating women (PLW). Nutrition in Emergencies (NiE), a life‑saving component of humanitarian action, remains critically underfunded and often conflated with food security. Unlike food assistance, NiE delivers targeted preventive and therapeutic services to mitigate acute malnutrition and safeguard maternal and child health. In 2020–2022, the nutrition sector received as little as 1.6% of required funds in major emergencies. This study quantifies the consequences of under‑delivery using a Cost of Inaction (CoI) lens to inform humanitarian programming, monitoring and evaluation.

# Methods

We adapted a CoI framework to estimate forgone benefits under four scenarios: no action (0%), current implementation, moderate scale‑up (30%), and ideal (95%) coverage. Direct (constitutive) benefits include lives saved and reduced malnutrition, modelled through the Lives Saved Tool (LiST). Indirect (consequential) benefits include household cost savings on breast‑milk substitutes (BMS) and preserved income from cognition gains linked to exclusive breastfeeding (EBF). Programme cost data were compiled from UNICEF country offices and standardised to constant 2015 USD. Principal components analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis identified patterns in delivery feasibility across countries and crises. Full model assumptions and sensitivity checks are provided in Supplementary Materials.

# Results

## Funding and Coverage Gaps

In the Eta/Iota hurricane response, implemented coverage was \~31%, while migration settings saw only \~2.7% coverage. Estimated investments for 95% coverage were US\$37.8 million and US\$111.3 million, respectively, but actual spending reached only 17% and 14% of those targets.

**Figure 2**: Principal component analysis (PCA) biplot showing variation in NiE delivery service clusters by feasibility and implementation across country contexts.

Three core service clusters were identified:

* **Cluster 1**: Standard child‑preventive bundle (feasible in all settings).
* **Cluster 2**: Diagnostics and treatment (dependent on functional systems).
* **Cluster 3**: Maternal iron/IFA interventions (limited to stable ANC platforms).

# Discussion

Despite moderate investment, NiE interventions have saved lives. However, the inaction gap remains vast. High returns to scale in migration settings suggest that even modest increases in funding could yield outsized health and economic returns. Service clustering highlights the need for phased implementation aligned with system readiness. The CoI framework usefully articulates missed opportunities and informs humanitarian decision‑making.

**Implications for humanitarian action.** Results support (i) prioritising universally feasible preventive services for rapid start‑up; (ii) scaling diagnostics/treatment as system functionality allows; and (iii) integrating maternal services where antenatal platforms are stable. Scenario‑based budgeting can improve appeal design and donor engagement.

**Limitations.** LiST may under‑detect effects for some maternal/neonatal outcomes where intervention coverage is low or clustered. Economic proxies rely on literature‑based links between EBF and cognition; country‑specific earnings paths introduce uncertainty addressed through sensitivity analysis.

# Conclusion

NiE is a core humanitarian response area. Failure to invest results in preventable mortality and foregone human capital. Phased packages, aligned with system readiness and backed by scenario‑based budgets, can accelerate humanitarian effectiveness in LAC and similar contexts.

  The Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region, marked by high disaster susceptibility and substantial migration flows, faces critical challenges in delivering nutrition-specific services during crises. Nutrition in Emergencies (NiE) is systematically underfunded, with large gaps between implemented responses and ideal coverage. This multi-country study, commissioned by UNICEF LACRO, quantifies the human and economic costs of inaction across two emergency typologies (2020–2022): the Eta–Iota hurricanes in Central America and regional migration flows. Adapting the Anand et al. (2012) Cost of Inaction (CoI) framework, we define inaction as the net benefit forgone when a feasible “ideal” NiE package—benchmarked at 95% coverage of People in Need (PiN)—is not delivered. Using the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) and R-based economic models, we estimate constitutive benefits (stillbirths and under-five deaths averted; changes in wasting, stunting, and exclusive breastfeeding) and consequential benefits (avoided household expenditure on breast-milk substitutes and preserved future income via cognition) across 0%, implemented, 30%, and 95% coverage scenarios. Implemented coverage averaged ~31% in Eta–Iota settings and ~2.7% in migration contexts, with expenditures representing only ~17% and ~14% of investment required for 95% coverage, respectively. Scaling to 95% coverage would avert additional stillbirths and child deaths and substantially increase exclusive breastfeeding. Undiscounted indirect benefits would rise to ~US$68.3 million (Eta–Iota) and ~US$336.9 million (migration); present values (3–5% real, base 2022) confirm strong economic returns. Principal component and cluster analyses identify a pragmatic sequencing of services—from a universally feasible child-preventive bundle to diagnostics/treatment and maternal iron/IFA dependent on system readiness. The inaction gap is large, measurable, and avoidable; scenario-based budgets and phased packages aligned with readiness triggers provide a practical pathway to close coverage gaps, improve survival, and preserve human capital.

> **Plain language summary.** Under-funding nutrition services in LAC emergencies leads to preventable child deaths and foregone economic potential. Comparing scenarios from “no response” to “near-universal coverage,” we estimate how many deaths could be averted and what financial benefits families and societies can gain—particularly via higher exclusive breastfeeding. We also identify which services are feasible to start first and which require stronger systems.

# Introduction

The Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region is among the most disaster-prone globally and hosts some of the largest per-capita migration flows. Crises driven by climate events and displacement interact with structural vulnerabilities, especially for children under five and pregnant or lactating women (PLW). While food security interventions address access to food, **Nutrition in Emergencies (NiE)** delivers targeted preventive and therapeutic services (e.g., IYCF, micronutrients, screening/treatment of acute malnutrition) essential to mitigate morbidity and mortality. Yet NiE is systematically underfunded; in several major emergencies, nutrition received as little as 1.6% of required funds (@OCHAFTS2022). This article applies a **Cost of Inaction (CoI)** lens (@Anand2012) to quantify forgone benefits and inform policy, building on evidence for the health and economic impacts of early nutrition (@Black2013; @Horton2010; @Bhutta2013).

# Methods

## Framework and scenarios

We adapted the CoI framework (@Anand2012), defining **inaction** as the net benefit forgone by not undertaking a feasible **ideal action**. Here, ideal action is a standards-aligned NiE package targeted to People in Need (PiN) at **95% coverage** (Sphere minimum standards; @Sphere2018). We model four scenarios: **0% (no action)**, **implemented (observed)**, **30%**, and **95%** coverage.

## Direct (constitutive) benefits

We used the **Lives Saved Tool (LiST)** to estimate changes in stillbirths, under-five mortality, wasting, stunting, and **exclusive breastfeeding (EBF)** under each scenario (@Walker2013). For migration responses, Venezuelan baselines were used as a proxy where migrant data were incomplete.

## Indirect (consequential) benefits and costs

From LiST-derived additional EBF infants, we monetised two pathways: (i) **avoided household expenditure on breast-milk substitutes (BMS)**, and (ii) **preserved future income via cognition** (earnings uplift linked to EBF; @Victora2016; consistent with @Walters2019). Monetary values are in **constant 2015 USD**. Present values (PV) for cognition use a **2022 base year** at **3–5% real**. The economic benefits of interventions span two periods: avoided formula costs during the child's first two years (0–24 months), and increased lifetime earnings projected from 2038–2080.

Programme delivery **costs** were compiled from UNICEF country offices; where necessary, we used median unit costs by intervention and context. We constructed **implemented** and **ideal** (95%) cost envelopes to benchmark financing gaps.

## Data, settings, and analysis

Two emergency typologies (2020–2022) were analysed: **Eta–Iota hurricanes** (Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua) and **regional migration flows** (Colombia, Honduras, Peru). Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering explored **delivery patterns** (feasibility clusters). Full assumptions, sensitivity checks, and reproducible R code are available (see *Research data & code*).

## Limitations

LiST uses national baselines that may understate emergency-period risks; migration baselines rely on proxy populations. Intervention costs depend on reporting by UNICEF country offices (COs); missingness was handled conservatively via medians. Indirect economic benefits were limited to the EBF channel to avoid double counting with health outcomes—yielding **conservative** estimates.

# Results

## Coverage and financing gaps (2020–2022)

Implemented coverage averaged **\~31%** in Eta–Iota and **\~2.7%** in migration contexts. Reaching 95% coverage would require **US\$37.8m** (Eta–Iota) and **US\$111.3m** (migration), while actual spending represented only **\~17%** and **\~14%** of those needs, respectively.

| Emergency | Population Group | Interventions Delivered | Interventions Needed | Coverage (%) | Funds Allocated (USD) | Funding Gap (USD) |
| --------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- | ------------ | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| Eta-Iota  | Children <5      | 8,799                   | 27,528               | 31.9%        | 6.4 million           | 31.4 million      |

Table 1 highlights substantial operational deficits. In the Eta–Iota response, less than one-third of children in need were reached, leaving a funding gap >US\$31m. In migration contexts, implemented coverage was <3% against need, with a shortfall near US\$100m. These gaps make explicit why downstream health and economic gains remain unrealised.

The **0% coverage** column provides the counterfactual burden in the absence of nutrition action. The **UNICEF response** columns show cases **averted** with observed coverage (e.g., 224 under-5 deaths averted in Eta–Iota; 244 in migration). Scaling to **95% coverage** would avert **an additional 643** (867–224) child deaths in Eta–Iota and **762** (1006–244) in migration. The same pattern holds for wasting: the averted caseload at 95% is roughly **2–3.5×** the implemented response. In short, the headroom for impact is large and actionable.

## Economic cost of inaction (consequential benefits)

```{r}
#| label: fig-economic-benefits
#| fig-cap: "Estimated indirect economic benefits from EBF and reduced BMS (millions of constant 2015 USD). Indirect benefits increase sharply with coverage, combining household BMS savings and cognition-linked income preservation."
#| echo: false
#| out.width: "80%"
#| fig.align: "center"

knitr::include_graphics("figures/econ-benefits-bar-chart.png")
```

Figure 1 shows **non-linear gains** in indirect benefits as coverage rises, driven by (i) avoided BMS spending in the first 24 months and (ii) preserved earnings from cognition gains as today’s infants enter the workforce (2038–2080). The steep gradient from 30%→95% indicates that once foundational delivery is in place, marginal increases in coverage yield **disproportionately large** economic returns.

## Service delivery patterns

```{r}
#| label: fig-pca-biplot
#| fig-cap: "PCA biplot of intervention delivery components across country–context responses. Numeric labels denote intervention IDs (see Supplementary Table S1). Three feasibility clusters emerge: Cluster 1 (child-preventive bundle), Cluster 2 (diagnostics/treatment), Cluster 3 (maternal iron/IFA core)."
#| echo: false
#| out.width: "75%"
#| fig.align: "center"

knitr::include_graphics("figures/pca-biplot.png")
```

Figure 2 summarises co-delivery patterns. The **numeric codes** tag the underlying **NiE intervention IDs** (mapping in **Supplementary Table S1**). Cluster 1 groups universally feasible child-preventive actions; Clusters 2–3 require stronger systems (screen→refer→treat, reliable commodities, ANC linkages) and are the **first to degrade** under operational stress—explaining much of the inaction gap in migration corridors.

# Discussion

Three findings stand out. **First**, the measured **inaction gap** is large and tractable: moving from implemented to **30% or 95%** coverage yields substantial, accelerating **health** and **economic** returns. **Second**, **returns to NiE investment** align with global evidence that early nutrition is among the highest-value health investments (@Horton2010; @Bhutta2013; @Black2013). **Third**, under-delivery is **patterned**, not random: services demanding robust screen-refer-treat pathways and ANC linkages (Clusters 2–3) are the first to falter in fragile and highly mobile contexts—strongly arguing for **phased** design and **readiness triggers**.

**Implications.** Phase services deliberately: institutionalise **Cluster 1** everywhere; scale **Cluster 2** once supply/referral readiness is proven; add **Cluster 3** where ANC platforms are stable. Funding requests should be **scenario-based** (implemented→30%→95%) and tie asks to **quantified returns** (lives saved, EBF gains, PV of income preserved). Position NiE distinctly (not conflated with food security), referencing **Sphere** standards (@Sphere2018) and **FTS** resource gaps (@OCHAFTS2022).

**Limitations.** Estimates likely **understate** true benefits: LiST baselines may be conservative for acute emergencies; EBF monetisation excludes other plausible spillovers. Cost medians smooth local price variability.

# Conclusion

NiE is a **core humanitarian function**. Underinvestment produces **preventable mortality** and **foregone human capital**. A CoI lens shows that scaling to **95% coverage** can deliver outsized, policy-relevant returns—especially in displacement-affected settings. A **phased package**, tied to **readiness triggers** and backed by **scenario-based budgeting**, offers a feasible route to close the gap and convert avoidable losses into **survival and productivity gains**.

# Recommendations

1. **Programme design (phase deliberately):** Institutionalise Cluster 1; scale Clusters 2–3 when trigger thresholds are met (screening coverage, stock reliability, referral completion).
2. **Measurement (track users and pathways):** Move beyond service contacts to privacy-preserving **unique-user** tracking across the **screen→refer→treat** cascade.
3. **Financing (scenario-based budgets):** Present costed options at implemented, 30%, and 95% coverage with **health and PV** returns; seek **multi-year, flexible** envelopes.
4. **Advocacy (quantified narrative):** Standardise a “three-line CoI story” per context: **funding gap → preventable deaths → EBF gains & PV**.

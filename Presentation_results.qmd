## Introduction – The Imperative for Action

- LAC is the second-most disaster-prone region globally and hosts the largest per capita migration flows.
- Nutrition in Emergencies (NiE) is life-saving and distinct from food security, yet it is systematically underfunded.
- **Objective**: Quantify the human and economic cost of inaction on NiE and support advocacy for increased investment.
- **Focus**: Children under five (especially under two) and pregnant and lactating women (PLW).

## Emergency Typologies (2020–2022)

1.  **Natural Disasters (Eta & Iota):**
    - Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua
    - >7.5 million affected

2.  **Migration Flows:**
    - Colombia, Honduras, Peru
    - ~7 million in need
    - Harsh transit (e.g. Darién Gap), high-risk environments

---

## Methodology – Cost of Inaction Framework

- Based on **Anand et al. (2012)** framework.
- **Scenarios**: 0% (no action), implemented, 30%, and 95% coverage.
- **Benefits**:
    - **Constitutive (Direct)**: Lives saved, stunting averted, EBF improvements (via LiST).
    - **Consequential (Indirect)**: BMS cost savings, future income from cognition gains.
- **Delivery analysis**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering.
- **Conservative assumptions**: LiST relies on non-emergency baselines; benefits use population-average elasticities; only the EBF channel is monetized.

## Key Finding: Coverage & Funding Gaps

- The analysis reveals a significant and costly gap between the implemented response and the investment required for an ideal response.

| | **Eta–Iota** | **Migration Flows** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Overall coverage delivered** | ~31% | ~2.7% |
| **Funding gap** | US$31.3 million | US$96.2 million |
| **% of ideal investment realised** | ~17% | ~14% |

* **Eta–Iota Response:**

  * **US\$6.51 million** spent, achieving **31% coverage**.
  * Only **17%** of the required **US\$37.83 million** for 95% coverage was met.
  * Resulting **funding gap**: **US\$31.32 million** (83% of ideal cost).

* **Migration Flows:**

  * **US\$15.09 million** spent, achieving just **2.7% coverage**.
  * Ideal funding required for 95% coverage: **US\$111.26 million**.
  * **Funding gap**: **US\$96.17 million** (86% of ideal cost).

* **Key Insight:**

  * There is a **profound underinvestment** in NiE, especially in migration contexts.
  * Reaching even **30% coverage** in migration settings would require **\~US\$18.3 million** in additional funding—more than double the current spend.

## Key Finding: Human Cost of Inaction

- **Inaction has a quantifiable human cost.** The table below illustrates the scale of preventable deaths and missed early nutrition opportunities.

| | **Eta–Iota (from ~31% coverage)** | **Migration Flows (from ~2.7% coverage)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Additional deaths averted at 95%** | +158 child deaths, +116 stillbirths | +1,009 child deaths, +419 stillbirths |
| **Additional EBF infants at 95%** | ≈+7,000 (total ~15,584) | ≈+34,000 (total ~35,874) |


---

## Key Finding: Human Cost of Inaction (cont.)

* **Current NiE interventions have saved lives**, but substantial **additional human gains remain unrealised**.

* In the **Eta–Iota response**, reaching 95% coverage could have prevented:

  * **+158 child deaths**, **+116 stillbirths**, and supported **\~7,000 more EBF infants**.

* In **migration settings** with critically low baseline coverage, scaling to 95% could have averted:

  * **+1,009 child deaths**, **+419 stillbirths**, and added **\~34,000 EBF infants**.

* These figures highlight a **clear opportunity for high-impact gains**, even from **modest increases in coverage**—especially in underfunded, high-risk contexts.

---

## Key Finding: Economic Cost of Inaction

- **NiE delivers immediate household relief and long-run productivity gains.**

| | **Eta–Iota** | **Migration** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total economic benefit at 95% (undiscounted)** | US$68.3 million | US$336.9 million |
| **PV of cognition gains at 95% (3% rate)** | US$13.9 million | US$89.5 million |

---

## Key Finding: Economic Cost of Inaction (cont.)

* **Nutrition in Emergencies yields substantial economic benefits**—both in short-term household savings and long-term productivity gains.

* In **Eta–Iota contexts**, scaling to 95% coverage would increase total economic benefit from **US\$38.6m to US\$68.3m**:

  * **BMS savings** rise from **US\$15.8m to US\$28.0m**.
  * **Cognition-linked income gains** (PV at 3%) increase from **US\$7.8m to US\$13.9m**.

* In **migration settings**, the return on investment is even more dramatic, with benefits rising from **US\$15.2m to US\$336.9m**:

  * **BMS savings** grow from **US\$2.9m to US\$64.3m**.
  * **Cognition-linked income gains** (PV at 3%) expand from **US\$4.0m to US\$89.5m**.

* These figures show that **inaction leads to major economic losses**, especially in **fragile, low-coverage contexts** where gains from scale-up are steep.

## Delivery Bottlenecks

- The under-delivery of services is not random but follows a predictable pattern.
- **Cluster 1**: Standard child-preventive bundle.
- **Cluster 2**: Diagnostics & treatment (e.g., PLW MUAC, child iron).
- **Cluster 3**: Maternal iron/IFA core.

- **Key Insight**: Gaps in Clusters 2 & 3 explain most of the inaction, reinforcing the need for a phased approach.

---

## Delivery Bottlenecks (cont.)

* **Delivery gaps are not random**: Intervention data show predictable patterns based on operational feasibility.

* **Three service clusters** emerged:

  * **Cluster 1** (child-preventive bundle) is widely feasible and consistently delivered.
  * **Clusters 2 & 3** (diagnostics, treatment, and maternal supplementation) require stronger systems and are often missing.

* **Under-delivery of Clusters 2 & 3**, especially in fragile and migration settings, drives much of the inaction gap.

* **Strategic implication**: Programme design must be **phased and aligned with system readiness**, not assumed scalable all at once.

## What Would 30% and 95% Deliver?

**Migration (from 2.7%)**
- **30% coverage**: ~300 additional child deaths and ~120 stillbirths averted, ~10,000 additional EBF infants supported.
- **95% coverage**: +1,009 additional child deaths and +419 stillbirths averted, ~34,000 more EBF infants supported.

**Eta–Iota (from ~31%)**
- **95% coverage**: +158 additional child deaths and +116 stillbirths averted, ~6,800 more EBF infants supported.

---

## Strategic Recommendations

1.  **Phase Programming:** Start with Cluster 1, then scale to Clusters 2 and 3 when readiness triggers are met.
2.  **Track Unique Users:** Implement privacy-preserving ID systems (e.g., PRIMES, hashed Kobo) to track individuals, not just service interactions.
3.  **Adopt Scenario Budgets:** Tie funding appeals to the quantified returns at 30% and 95% coverage levels.
4.  **Quantified Advocacy:** Develop a three-line CoI story for each context, linking funding gaps directly to lives and benefits forgone.

---

## Conclusion – Inaction Is Not Neutral

* **The gap is avoidable.** Scaling to 30% or 95% coverage would save thousands of lives and support tens of thousands more infants with exclusive breastfeeding.

* **Returns are high.** Even modest investments yield major gains—up to **US\$337M** in economic benefits in migration contexts alone.

* **Gaps are systemic.** Bottlenecks in maternal care, diagnostics, and supply chains—not lack of will—drive under-delivery.

* **Estimates are conservative.** The real human and economic costs of inaction are likely even higher.

* **NiE is foundational.** It must be financed as a core, life-saving sector—**not an optional add-on.**

* **Act now.** Phase delivery by readiness, budget by scenario, and anchor advocacy in one message:
  **Money saves lives now and protects futures later.**
